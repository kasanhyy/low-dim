# Low-dimensional PMM

This project is to simulate the result in the paper *Differentially private low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data*. The algorithm is applied in the scenario of recognizing handwritten digits. More details of the algorithm can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17148.
